I started my journey in tech with a love for building things and quickly found joy in solving real-world problems through code. Over time, my role has evolved from writing software to shaping the systems and strategies behind it.  \n<br>\nI came into the field with a background in philosophy, which continues to shape how I approach problems\u2014asking better questions, thinking critically, and communicating clearly. As I've stepped into architectural roles, those skills have become just as valuable as my technical ones.  \n<br>\nMy fascination with artificial intelligence started early. At one of my first hackathons, I built a simple Connect Four AI that helped our team win first place\u2014and I've been hooked ever since. When ChatGPT launched, I immediately recognized its potential. That moment deepened my commitment to AI and led me to launch internal hackathons, organize community meetups during the early GPT-3 days, and pursue a master's in Applied AI.  \n<br>\nToday, I'm focused on building AI that makes a difference in how we work, think, and interact with the world.  \n\n# I like\n- Chess\n- Running\n- Soccer\n- Pottery\n- Rock Climbing\n- 3d Printing\n- Robotics\n- CAD\n- Backpacking\n- Wilderness Survival\n- Long cycling trips\n- Reading\n- Tea - Matcha Lattes especially\n\n# Fun facts\n- I fell in love with Pottery during COVID lockdown, its such a cool blend of skill and art.\n- I once rode my bicyle from Banff, Canada to San Francisco, California. (almost 2000 miles!)\n- I co-founded a wilderness survival group, and go on yearly (well, almost yearly) trips where the only rule is you can't bring food.\n- I'm a fan of polar plunges, and have swam with iceburgs in Iceland and Patagonia.",d=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,l.jsx)(a.rU,(0,t.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Brian Morris",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(a.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(r(),{source:c,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
