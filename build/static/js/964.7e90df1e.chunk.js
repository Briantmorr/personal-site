This has lead me to get heavily involved with cloud native and DevOps in my current position at SAP Eureka. Eureka is SAP's initiative to apply modern cloud solutions to their existing ecosystem. There we are building next generation cloud native solutions. I love working on cutting edge technology, and appreciate the support I receive when I propose new ideas. \nI came into tech with a background in philosphy. I've always loved problem solving, but the more I grow into the role of an architect, I increasingly value my skills in communication and approaching problems in non-traditional ways. \n\n# I like\n- Soccer\n- Chess\n- 3d Printing\n- Pottery\n- Running\n- Robotics\n- Rock Climbing\n- CAD\n- Backpacking\n- Wilderness Survival\n- Long cycling trips\n- Reading\n- Tea - Matcha Lattes especially\n\n# Fun facts\n- I fell in love with Pottery during lockdown, its such a cool blend of skill and art.\n- I once rode my bicyle from Banff, Canada to San Francisco, California.\n- I co-founded a wilderness survival group, and go on yearly (well, almost yearly) trips where the only rule is you can't bring food.\n- I'm a fan of polar plunges (Wim Hof anyone?), and have swum with iceburgs in Iceland and Patagonia.\n- I enjoy experimenting with ML in my spare time.
