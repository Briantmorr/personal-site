# Intro

I'm a software engineer with a passion for understanding how things work. I started my journey in tech with a love for building things and quickly found joy in solving real-world problems through code. Over time, my role has evolved from writing software to shaping the systems and strategies behind it.  
<br>
I came into the field with a background in philosophy, which continues to shape how I approach problems—asking better questions, thinking critically, and communicating clearly. As I've stepped into architectural roles, those skills have become just as valuable as my technical ones.  
<br>
My fascination with AI started early. At one of my first hackathons, I built a simple Connect Four AI that helped our team win first place—and I've been hooked ever since. When ChatGPT launched, I immediately recognized its potential. That moment deepened my commitment to AI and led me to launch internal hackathons, organize community meetups during the early GPT-3 days, and obtain a master's in Applied AI.  
<br>
Today, I'm focused on building AI that makes a difference in how we work, think, and interact with the world.
